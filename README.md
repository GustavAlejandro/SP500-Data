# SP500-Data
In this repository I show how to get stock market data, specifically for the S&P500 and remove missing values (Nan values). I did it in three separate notebooks to identify errors in the future, but it can be done in a single one.
The programs can be modified in order to get a different time span or a different stock market such as the Nasdaq.
